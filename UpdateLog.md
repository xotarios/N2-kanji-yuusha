* Added : English version added (English translation for kanji vocabs and example sentences)  
* Fixed : When using the virtual keyboard, ghost alphabet(s) (i.e. non-vowel alphabet(s)) typed before the first successfully typed hiragana is overlapped by the placeholder.  
* Enhanced : When using the virtual keyboard, unnecessary ghost alphabets will now automatically be deleted before any successfully typed hiragana, and will not be part of the words typed in the entry field even if you type a lot of them.
